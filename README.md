# Fashion Recommender System Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a Fashion Recommender System implemented using deep learning. The system leverages the pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract image embeddings and employs the Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find the most similar embeddings based on input images. The project also includes a Streamlit app for interactive use.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the system is sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset at the following link: [Fashion Product Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small)

## Requirements

To run the code and use the recommender system, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
